   <build value="0" date="2004-12-01" time="18:00">
       Initiation of the versioning system.

      Added support for remote authentication of devices while connections are already established.
    </build>
    <build value="2" date="2004-12-08" time="16:52">
 		Fixed bug in MInputStream.read(), where the byte transferred and casted to an int needed to be and-0xff'ed.
 		BluetoothStream in ObexInputStream.
    </build>
    <build value="3" date="2004-12-10" time="23:00">
    		DataElement Strings changed to UTF-8 to support Umlauts. MacOS X can't handle that yet.

    </build>  
    <build value="4" date="2004-12-13" time="14:30">
		Moved Connector class to de.avetana.bluetooth.connection.Connector.

		Added getConnectorURL() to LocalServiceRecord
		Changed acceptAndOpen() Methods in RFComm and L2CAP Notifiers to remove the SDP Entry when the connection is established.
		close() still tries to remove it but it won't do anything.
		After the connection is established, acceptAndOpen() can be called again without having to close the notifier or the connection.
		This was mainly needed to be compatible with blueCove.
    </build> 
    <build value="6" date="2004-12-26" time="22:30">

    </build>
    <build value="12" date="2005-01-17" time="10:04">

    <build value="15" date="2005-01-21" time="14:16">
    	  More updates in OBEX. 
    	  Added support for setPath in SessionNotifierImpl.

     Moved all RFComm classes to de.avetana.bluetooth.rfcomm and deleted LocalConnection and LocalConnectionNotifier.
     Changed the data-receiving model from polling Java->JNI to having JNI notify Java of new incoming data. This data is stored
     in a Vector in the BTConnection class from where it is used in either RFCommConenction ot L2CAPConenction.

    </build>
    <build value="7" date="2005-06-11">

    <build value="12" date="2005-07-17">

    </build>
    <build value="13" date="2005-07-28">
     Fixed some PocketPC native problems with AttachCurrentThread, where GetEnv would not really get the Environment in CrEme.
     Native side is now calling deviceDiscovered() in BlueZ to notifiy of newly found devices. That way we don't need to store the DiscoveryAgent.
    </build>
    <build value="14" date="2005-08-02">

     -many improvements in native code on all plattforms.
     -now handles multithreaded acceptAndOpen() to serve multiple connections on the same channel
     -fully MIDP-Compliant. Works with J9 MIDP (needs special distribution)
     -Exception handling in callback methods deviceDiscovered and servicesDiscovered
     -Removed many of the synchronized tags in BlueZ to be able to open Connections from multiple threads at the same time.

     -changed the authenticate method in BlueZ to accept a JSR-82 style bluetooth address
     -added an unPair method to BlueZ
     fixed a bug in de.avetana.bluetooth.connection.ConnectionNotifier that would make the app crash when acceptAndOpen was called on a closed notifier.
    </build>
    <build value="6" date="2006-02-23">
    	-Implemented new licensing scheme to include a signed license.txt file that contains validity, possibilities and valid addresses.
    	-Create class SessionHandler that handles an OBEX Server connection after acceptAndOpen in a separate Thread. Now OBEX Conenctions can be offered right after acceptAndOpen has been called.
     -Changed managmenet of ServiceRecord-updating in order to get it to work with J9-MIDP. ConnectionNotifiers do now implement a RecordOwner interface that gives access to the service record.
     This also fixes a problem where only one ServiceRecord at a time could be manipulated.
	</build>
    <build value="7" date="2006-03-03">
